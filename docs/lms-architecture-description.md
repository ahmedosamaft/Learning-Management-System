The architecture has been evaluated against the following quality attributes:
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Security
- Performance
- Reliability
- Modifiability

#### 1.3.3 Rationale for Key Decisions
The monolithic architecture was chosen for the following reasons:
1. Simplified development and deployment process
2. Easier debugging and testing
3. Reduced complexity in team coordination
4. Straightforward transaction management
5. Better performance for small to medium-scale applications

## 2. Stakeholders and Concerns

### 2.1 Stakeholders
1. System Users
   - Administrators
   - Instructors
   - Students

2. Development Team
   - Software Developers
   - Software Architects

### 2.2 Concerns
#### Purposes of the System-of-Interest
The primary purpose of the Learning Management System (LMS) is to provide a centralized platform for educational institutions to manage courses, students, instructors, and learning materials. It aims to streamline administrative tasks, improve learning outcomes, and offer a scalable, secure, and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders, including students, instructors, and administrators.

#### Suitability of the Architecture
Using a *monolithic* architecture, the system provides the following benefits:

- **Tight integration of features**: All functional modules (e.g., authentication, course management, assessments) are tightly coupled, ensuring seamless communication and consistent performance.

- **Ease of deployment**: The entire system is deployed as a single unit, reducing complexity in the deployment process.

- **Simplified development**: The monolithic design minimizes the overhead of managing inter-service communication, making it suitable for small to medium-sized teams during initial development.
While suitable for the project's scale and initial purpose, potential limitations in scalability and flexibility for future expansions must be addressed.

#### Feasibility of Construction and Deployment
- **Technology stack**: The choice of Java as the primary language ensures high performance, robust security, and extensive community support.

- **Development feasibility**: Java Spring Boot framework simplifies implementing features such as authentication, course management, and notifications.

- **Deployment feasibility**: Deployment in a monolithic architecture is straightforward, requiring only one runtime environment or container, which can simplify DevOps processes.

#### Risks and Impacts
- **Scalability challenges**: A monolithic architecture might face bottlenecks as user demands increase.

- **Single point of failure**: Issues in one module could potentially affect the entire system.

- **Stakeholder impacts**: Stakeholders benefit from rapid development and deployment but may face delays or downtime during system updates, given the monolithic design.

- **Long-term costs**: As the system evolves, maintaining a monolithic codebase might become more challenging, increasing technical debt.

#### Maintenance and Evolution
- **Maintainability**: The use of well-structured code practices, clear module boundaries, and robust testing strategies ensures maintainability. However, significant refactoring might be required for future scalability.

- **Evolution**: The architecture can evolve by:
Refactoring individual modules into services as needed (*eventual migration to microservices*, if required).
Implementing feature toggles to enable iterative deployment of new features.
Enhancing modularization within the monolithic codebase to simplify updates and feature additions.

#### Summary of Concerns
1. **Functional Concerns**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Profile Management
   - Course management
   - Attendance Management
   - Assessment & Grading management
   - Student Progress Tracking
   - Generating Reports on student performance (Performance Analytics)
   - Media management
   - Notification system

2. **Quality Attribute Concerns**
   - **Security**: Robust authentication and encryption mechanisms protect sensitive data.

   - **Performance**: The system handles concurrent users through optimized database queries and efficient threading.

   - **Reliability**: Data integrity is ensured through ACID-compliant database transactions.

   - **Availability**: Use of robust runtime environments and regular backups to maximize uptime.

   - **Scalability**: Initial focus on horizontal scaling of the monolith; modularization can ease future transitions.

   - **Maintainability**: Clean coding practices, adherence to design patterns, and a clear separation of concerns reduce maintenance overhead.

- Role-based access to functionalities.
- Data flow and process synchronization.

#### Typical Stakeholders
- **Developers**: Understand functional dependencies and system organization.
- **Architects**: Ensure modular and maintainable design.
- **System Administrators**: Manage configurations and dependencies.

#### Model Kinds
- **Use Case Diagram**: Depicts system functionalities for each user role (Admin, Instructor, Student).
- **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates workflows such as student enrollment, instructor grading, and notification generation.

#### Operations on Views
- **Construction Methods**:  
  Use process guidance to break the LMS into modules such as User Management, Course Management, Assessment, and Notification. Apply UML-based patterns for creating use case and sequence diagrams.
- **Interpretation Methods**:  
  Provide stakeholders with a guide to trace workflows (e.g., student enrollment) across modules and interpret interactions in sequence diagrams.
- **Analysis Methods**:  
  Evaluate the logical consistency of functional decomposition and ensure workflows do not introduce redundant or conflicting operations.
- **Implementation Methods**:  
  Use the logical view as a blueprint for implementing system components in Spring Boot.

#### Correspondence Rules
- Each functional component in the logical view must map directly to a corresponding module in the implementation view.
- Interactions between components in the sequence diagrams must match the APIs defined in the implementation.

### 3.2 Data Viewpoint
#### Overview
The data viewpoint focuses on how data is structured, stored, and exchanged within the system. It defines the relationships between entities such as users, courses, and assessments, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

#### Concerns Addressed

- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Shows the flow of data between system components such as enrollment processes and grading.

#### Operations on Views
- **Construction Methods**:  
  Use entity-relationship modeling techniques to create ERDs for key entities (Users, Courses, Assessments, Notifications). Develop data flow diagrams to map how data is exchanged between modules.
- **Interpretation Methods**:  
  Provide a walkthrough of how each entity (e.g., Users) interacts with others and how data flows between operations (e.g., student enrollment, grading).
- **Analysis Methods**:  
  Validate referential integrity between related entities (e.g., Users ↔ Courses) and ensure the data flow supports operational needs.
- **Implementation Methods**:  
  Use the data view as the basis for designing database schemas and defining APIs for CRUD operations.

#### Correspondence Rules
- Each entity in the ERD must have a corresponding table in the database schema.
- Data flows defined in the DFD must align with the methods and data operations implemented in the backend.
