    - The affected components or models.
    - The reasons for the inconsistency (e.g., limited time, evolving requirements).
    - Proposed resolutions and their timelines.

---

### 5.2 Correspondences
Correspondences ensure consistency between the various elements of the AD and their implementation. Below are the key correspondences for the LMS:

- **Logical Components â†” Spring Boot Components**:
  - Each logical feature (e.g., authentication, course management) is implemented using specific Spring Boot components (e.g., controllers, services, repositories).
  - Example: `AuthenticationService` â†” `AuthenticationController`.

- **Database Entities â†” Domain Models**:
  - Database tables are directly mapped to domain model classes for data representation.
  - Example: `users` table â†” `User` entity.

- **REST Endpoints â†” Service Operations**:
  - Each REST API endpoint corresponds to a defined service operation.
  - Example: `GET /api/courses` â†” `CourseService.getAllCourses()`.

- **Stakeholder Needs â†” Functional Modules**:
  - Stakeholder concerns are addressed through corresponding functional modules.
  - Example: "Course Management" (Instructor need) â†” `CourseModule`.

- **Views â†” Code Implementation**:
  - The functional and logical views of the system map directly to modules in the codebase.
